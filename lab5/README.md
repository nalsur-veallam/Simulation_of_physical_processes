I kind of did it, but it turned out to be quite strange results, to be honest, I expected that everything would be fine with hoyne, but it turns out why the fact that everything is much better with Euler, at least its amplitude increases there. I don't quite understand the applicability of these methods, because Euler is obviously also wrong (since he was wrong without viscous friction). 

About the files in the lab5 folder :  
- "- "code.cpp " contains code in the Cpp language with the implementation of the Hahn and Euler methods for solving pendulum oscillations in a gravity field with viscous friction. The fstream library is used.

- "graph.py " contains python code and renders energy graphs (FULL_ENERGY.png), motion graph (MOTION_GRAPH.png) and phase diagram (PHASE_DIAGRAM.png). The matplotlib and numpy libraries are used.

- "a.out " - executable file

- "points.txt " contains a set of calculated points
